# Buck Converter 

A buck converter is a high-efficiency power conversion circuit that steps down a higher input voltage to a lower output voltage for a load. Unlike simple methods such as resistor dividers, which dissipate energy as heat, it uses switching elements (typically MOSFETs) and inductive filtering to regulate voltage efficiently, often achieving >90% efficiency.

This project covered the full design cycle, including schematic creation, PCB layout, soldering components on the manufactured board, and comprehensive testing using an oscilloscope, function generator, and digital multimeter.
